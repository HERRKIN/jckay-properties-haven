    "aboutConcrete": "About Concrete",
    "aboutFence": "About Wood Fences",
    "general": "General",
    "concreteQ1": "How long should I wait to walk or park my car on new concrete?",
    "concreteA1": "You can walk on it after 24 hours. For light vehicles, we recommend waiting at least 7 days, and for trucks or heavy machinery, 28 days is ideal (when concrete reaches maximum strength).",
    "concreteQ2": "Will the concrete crack?",
    "concreteA2": "Concrete tends to expand and contract. To prevent uncontrolled cracking, we install strategic control joints. This guides any natural movement and maintains the surface aesthetics.",
    "concreteQ3": "Is it necessary to seal concrete?",
    "concreteA3": "Yes, we strongly recommend it. Sealing protects against oil stains, chemicals, and sun wear, doubling the life of your investment.",
    "fenceQ1": "What type of wood do you use?",
    "fenceA1": "We mainly work with Cedar (naturally resistant to rot and insects) and pressure-treated Pine (a durable and economical option). We can advise which best fits your budget.",
    "fenceQ2": "How long does a wood fence last?",
    "fenceA2": "With proper maintenance (cleaning and sealing every 2-3 years), a quality fence can last 15 to 20 years.",
    "fenceQ3": "Do you handle building permits?",
    "fenceA3": "We can guide you through the process. Regulations generally vary by city or homeowners association (HOA). We provide the plans or technical specifications you need for the process.",
    "generalQ1": "Do you offer free, no-obligation quotes?",
    "generalA1": "Absolutely! We visit your property, take measurements, and provide a detailed quote at no cost.",
